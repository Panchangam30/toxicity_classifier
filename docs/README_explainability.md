# Explainability & Confidence Module

## Purpose

Provides model confidence and disagreement information (stubbed for now).

## Implementation

- Returns a random confidence value (0â€“1)
- Returns an empty list for disagreements
- TODO: Integrate real explainability/confidence logic

## Usage

Called automatically by the main pipeline. Example:

```python
from modules.explainability import get_explainability_and_confidence
print(get_explainability_and_confidence({}))
```

## Output

- Dict with 'model_confidence' and 'disagreements' keys

## Notes

- Replace stub with real logic as available
- See main README for setup and usage
